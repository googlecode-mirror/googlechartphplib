#summary Standard features for (almost) all the charts

<wiki:toc/>

Those are the standard chart features available for a majority of the charts types.

This page is just an highlight of the main features and function for `GoogleChart` class. For a more complete documentation, you should read the 
[http://googlechartphplib.cloudconnected.fr/doc/classGoogleChart.html API Documentation] generated by Doxygen.

= Chart title =

You can specify the title text, color, and font size for your chart.

== Methods ==

|| `setTitle($title [, $color, [$size]])` || Set the title for the chart.  Use \n to insert a line break. Since v0.7 the two additional parameters `$color` and `$size` are shortcuts for the methods below. ||
|| `setTitleColor($color)` || Set a color for the title using RRGGBB format ||
|| `setTitleSize($size)` || Set the size of the title, in points ||

== Example ==

<table>
<tr>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
A blue title of 18pt.

{{{
$chart = new GoogleBarChart('bvs', 180, 150);

$chart->addData(array(10,15,25,30,45,55,58));

$chart->setTitle("Site visitors by month\nJanuary to July", '336699', 18);

echo $chart->toHtml();
}}}

= Legends =

The legend is a side section of the chart that gives a small text description of each series. You can specify the text associated with each series in this legend, and specify where on the chart it should appear. See [GoogleChartData Data Series Features] to know how to set the text associated with each series.

== Methods ==

|| `setLegendPosition($position)` || Set the position of the legend box. One of the following: 'b', 'bv', 't', 'tv', 'r', 'l'. See below. ||
|| `setLegendLabelOrder($label_order)` || Set the the label order. One of the following: 'l', 'r', 'a', or a list of numbers. See below. ||
|| setLegendSkipEmpty($skip_empty)` || By default, empty legends (without text) are not shown. You can disable this to display all the legends, even if not text was provided. ||
|| setLegendSize($width, $height)` || Set the size of the legend box, in pixels. ||

List of possible positions:

  * b - Legend at the bottom of the chart, legend entries in a horizontal row.
  * bv - Legend at the bottom of the chart, legend entries in a vertical column.
  * t - Legend at the top of the chart, legend entries in a horizontal row.
  * tv - Legend at the top of the chart, legend entries in a vertical column.
  * r - [Default] Legend to the right of the chart, legend entries in a vertical column.
  * l - Legend to the left of the chart, legend entries in a vertical column.

List of possible orders:

  * l - [Default for vertical legends] Display labels in the order in the orders where the data series has been added to the chart.
  * r - Display labels in the reverse order. This is useful in stacked bar charts to show the legend in the same order as the bars appear.
  * a - [Default for horizontal legends] Automatic ordering: roughly means sorting by length, shortest first, as measured in 10 pixel blocks. When two elements are the same length (divided into 10 pixel blocks), the one listed first will appear first.
  * 0,1,2... - Custom label order. This is a list of zero-based label indexes from the data series, separated by commas.

= Margins =

You can specify the size of the chart's margins, in pixels. Margins are calculated inward from the specified chart size (chs); increasing the margin size does not increase the total chart size, but rather shrinks the chart area, if necessary.
The margins are by default whatever is left over after the chart size is calculated. This default value varies by chart type. The margins that you specify are a minimum value; if the chart area leaves room for margins, the margin size will be whatever is left over; you cannot squeeze the margins smaller than what is required for any legends and labels. Here's a diagram showing the basic parts of a chart:

http://code.google.com/apis/chart/images/chart_elements.gif

The chart margins include the axis labels and the legend area. The legend area resizes automatically to fit the text exactly, unless you specify a larger width, in which case it will expand the margin size wider, squeezing the chart area smaller. You cannot crop a legend by specifying a size that is too small, but you can make it take up more space than it needs.
